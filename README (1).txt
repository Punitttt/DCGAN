# DCGAN Project

This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) in a Jupyter Notebook. The project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a DCGAN model for generating images.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two competing neural networks: a generator that produces fake images and a discriminator that evaluates them against real images. In this project, the DCGAN leverages convolutional layers to effectively generate realistic images. The notebook, `DCGAN_079.ipynb`, contains all the necessary code and explanations to understand and experiment with the model.

## Features

- **DCGAN Implementation:** A full implementation of a DCGAN using deep convolutional layers.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Step-by-step training of the generator and discriminator with visualizations.
- **Image Generation:** Generation of new images from the trained model.
- **Extensible Code:** Easily modify the network architecture, training parameters, or dataset.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**
- **Deep Learning Framework:** [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (or TensorFlow, depending on your implementation)
- **Additional Libraries:** 
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - torchvision (if using PyTorch)  
  - Other dependencies as required by the notebook

Install the necessary Python packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all dependencies.*

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DCGAN_Project.git
   cd DCGAN_Project
   ```

2. **Launch the Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook DCGAN_079.ipynb
   ```
   Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the DCGAN model.

3. **Dataset Setup:**
   - The notebook may use a dataset (e.g., CelebA, CIFAR-10, etc.) for training the model.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to download and prepare the dataset.
   - Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory as expected by the code.

## Results

During training, the notebook will display:
- Loss curves for both the generator and discriminator.
- Sample images generated by the model at various training epochs.

Review these outputs to monitor the training progress and assess the quality of the generated images.
